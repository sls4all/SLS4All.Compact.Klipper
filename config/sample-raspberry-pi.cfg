# This file contains an example configuration with RPi as secondary mcu

# See both the example.cfg and example-extras.cfg file for a
# description of available parameters.

# The rpi microcontroller is used as secondary.
# Typically, both the X and Y axes
# are connected to the main micro-controller. The rpi microcontroller is used
# on non time-critical functions such as enclosure sensors, additional fan or
# light sources

# Example1: A led strip controlled by the GPIO20 on the RPi
[output_pin caselight]
pin: host:gpio20
# You can also write the pin in extended form by specifying
# the reference gpiochip.
